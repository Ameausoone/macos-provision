# Code Quality & Style

## Strict

Be strict on proposed code

## Simplicity

Keep code and documentation simple and straightforward:

* Write tight, simple scripts without excessive formatting
* Avoid colored output in error messages unless specifically requested
* READMEs should be minimal and straight to the point - only essential setup and usage info
* No verbose explanations or examples unless needed
